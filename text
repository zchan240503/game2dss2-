Hello everyone, this is my first project. To be honest, my knowledge of algorithms is still quite bad.
Everything you see I watch and learn from the YouTube channel Ryisnow, but right now I can't. I can continue because
I have a few errors that I don't know how to solve. My code builds a map with impassable barriers and fixed paths, a blue boy can move. 
and an npc old man will automatically find his way to the upper left corner of the map (I have 2 old men, if you see which old man goes faster, it means I have installed an algorithm on that old man)
but the problem is Currently, when the boy I control approaches the old man from one of four sides (left, right, top, bottom) by touching the old man and pressing 'E',
the old man just moves in that direction without actually moving. now find the path as I have installed in the algorithm. I would like your help if possible please help me solve this problem,
thanks in advance
